# API

_**NB!** Upcoming in v0.2.0 release. As the project matures, API will be
extended to give you more control over the mod._

API allows you to add you own submenu on the fly without bothering much with
dependencies as long as the global `DevToolsAPI` is available. For example, you
can create you own mod-specific submenu from your own mod with all the options
you may need throughout the development/testing, and it will be displayed along
with other Dev Tools submenus.

**Coming soon.**
